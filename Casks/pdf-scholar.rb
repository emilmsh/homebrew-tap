  # The macOS build is unsigned (a deliberate zero-cost decision — see

  caveats <<~EOS
    PDF Scholar's macOS build is unsigned, so macOS quarantines it on
    every install and upgrade. If Gatekeeper reports the app as damaged
    when it first opens, clear the flag:

      xattr -cr "/Applications/PDF Scholar.app"

    Unsigned apps cannot auto-update; new versions arrive with

      brew upgrade --cask pdf-scholar
  EOS
end
